# Navbar Examples

This is a collection of custom-designed and remade navbars that I've come across on the internet for web development projects. You're welcome to use it if you find it interesting, inspiring, or learn something from it.

## Introduction

I developed this collection using **React** + **Vite**. I hope to publish more navbar designs to help you with your web development projects.

## Usage

To use a navbar in your project, follow these steps:

1. Choose a navbar design from the `src` directory.
2. Copy the HTML and SCSS code for the selected navbar.
3. Paste the code into your project's HTML and SCSS files, respectively.
4. Customize the navbar according to your project's requirements.

## Demo

For a live demonstration of each navbar, check out the [Demo Page](link-to-demo-page).

You can download the navbar source code directly from this repository.

### Development

- Start the development server: `yarn dev`
